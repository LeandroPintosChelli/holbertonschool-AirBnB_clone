<h1 align="center">AirBnB clone - The console</h1>

---

## Description:

HolbertonBnB is a complete web application, integrating database storage, 
a back-end API, and front-end interfacing in a clone of AirBnB.

> This is the first phase of the Airbnb Clone: the console.
> This repository holds a command interpreter and classes (i.e. BaseModel class
> and several other classes that inherit from it: Amenity, City, State, Place,
> Review), and a command interpreter. The command interpreter, like a shell,
> can be activated, take in user input, and perform certain tasks
> to manipulate the object instances.
